## Mistake 2: Not Checking Official Documentation Before Implementation

### What I Did Wrong:

- Attempted to create components and stores using Svelte 5 runes
- Used syntax like `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props` without verification
- Created files with wrong extensions (`stores/*.svelte.ts`)

### Root Cause:

- I was working with outdated mental models of Svelte
- Didn't consult official documentation for Svelte 5

### Correct Approach:

- **Read official documentation before using new features**
- AGENTS.md says: "Before writing code, consult: Vite, Svelte 5, Vite, Panda CSS"
- I should have opened: https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/llms.txt (which I did, but misread)
- Should have verified Svelte 5 project structure conventions

### Reference:

- https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/llms.txt
- https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/
- https://vite.dev/llms.txt
