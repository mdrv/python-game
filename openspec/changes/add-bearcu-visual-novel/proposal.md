# Change: Add Bearcu Visual Novel Application

## Why

Create an educational visual novel that teaches Python programming to Indonesian children through an engaging story featuring Bearcu, a friendly teddy bear character. This combines interactive storytelling with hands-on coding exercises in a fun, accessible format.

## What Changes

- Initialize Vite + Svelte SPA project for the visual novel
- Create visual novel engine (dialogue system, scene management, character display)
- Implement Bearcu character with expressions/animations
- Build Python code interactive learning modules (simple exercises for kids)
- Add full Indonesian language localization for all text and UI
- Create initial story chapters introducing Python concepts
- Implement code execution/preview interface for kid-friendly Python
- Set up IndexedDB for storing kid progress, achievements, and code submissions
- Implement auto-save system that saves after every scene, code submission, and achievement

## Impact

- New specs: `visual-novel-engine`, `python-learning-modules`, `indonesian-content`, `bearcu-character`
- New code: Complete Vite + Svelte SPA with TypeScript
- Assets: Bearcu character graphics, background scenes, UI elements
- Documentation: Story outline, Python learning progression
